### 1. Install Dependencies

2. Clone the Repository

Clone the dotfiles repository to your home directory:

git clone https://github.com/Matt-FTW/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles

Make sure that you have Git installed before running this command. You can install it via:

sudo apt install git

3. Backup Existing Configurations

It's always a good idea to back up your current configuration before making any changes. This allows you to revert to your previous setup if necessary.

mkdir -p ~/.config/backup
cp -r ~/.config/hypr ~/.config/backup/
cp -r ~/.config/waybar ~/.config/backup/
cp -r ~/.config/kitty ~/.config/backup/

4. Apply the Dotfiles

Now that you have the repository cloned and your backups in place, apply the dotfiles to your system:

cp -r ~/dotfiles/.config/* ~/.config/

This will replace existing configuration files with those from the repository. Ensure your backups are safely stored in case you need to revert.

5. Set Fish as Default Shell

This repository uses Fish as the default shell for the terminal. If you're not using Fish already, you can set it as the default shell by running:

chsh -s /usr/bin/fish

After setting Fish as the default shell, close and reopen your terminal to see the changes.

6. Restart Your System

To ensure the changes take effect fully, it's recommended to restart your system or log out and back in:

sudo reboot

‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings & Notes
