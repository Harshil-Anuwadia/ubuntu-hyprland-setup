Hey there, Ubuntu adventurer! 👋 

Are you tired of your boring old desktop? Want to make your computer look so good that people will think you're hacking the Matrix? Well, you've just stumbled upon the promised land! 🌈

This guide will help you install some amazing Hyprland dotfiles on your Ubuntu 24.04 system. And the best part? We'll make it fun! (Yes, even the terminal commands can be fun... sort of 😅)

- ⌨️ Working keyboard (hopefully)
- 🖱️ Mouse (optional, because we're keyboard warriors!)

## 🛠️ Installation

### Step 0: Preparation 🏃‍♂️
First, let's get you mentally prepared:
1. Take a deep breath
2. Make a backup (because YOLO is not a backup strategy)
3. Get your favorite beverage ready
4. Tell your family you love them (just kidding, but maybe?)

### Step 1: The Great Package Installation! 📦

Time to make your package manager work for its living! Open your terminal (don't worry, it doesn't bite... much):

```bash
# First, let's update your system (because why not start fresh?)
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Now, let's install ALL THE THINGS! 🎉
sudo apt install -y \
    hyprland `# For the awesome window management` \
    waybar `# To make your top bar pretty` \
    kitty `# The most adorable terminal ever` \
    neovim `# Because vim wasn't complex enough` \
    fish `# A shell that's actually friendly` \
    rofi `# Application launcher extraordinaire` \
    dunst `# For those fancy notifications` \
    fonts-nerd-fonts-complete `# Because normal fonts are boring` \
    spicetify-cli `# Make Spotify match your rice` \
    git `# Because we're not cavemen` \
    brightnessctl `# Control brightness like a boss` \
    network-manager `# Internet is kind of important` \
    pulseaudio `# For the sweet tunes` \
    pavucontrol `# Audio control that makes sense` \

    slurp `# Select screen areas like a pro` \
    wl-clipboard `# Clipboard magic`
```

> 🎵 *While this installs, why not enjoy a cup of coffee or practice your Vim exit strategies?*

### Step 2: Backup Like a Paranoid Pro! 💾

Because breaking things is fun, fixing them is not. Let's create backups:

```bash
# Create our backup fortress
mkdir -p ~/.config/backup-before-awesomeness

# Back up ALL the things!
for dir in hypr waybar kitty nvim fish rofi dunst; do
    if [ -d "$HOME/.config/$dir" ]; then
        echo "📦 Backing up $dir configuration..."
        cp -r "$HOME/.config/$dir" "$HOME/.config/backup-before-awesomeness/"
    else
        echo "🤔 No $dir config found, skipping..."
    fi
done

echo "🎉 Backup complete! Your future self thanks you!"
```

### Step 3: Clone Those Dotfiles Like a Boss! 🦾

```bash
# Let's get those amazing dotfiles
echo "🚀 Preparing for awesomeness..."
git clone https://github.com/Matt-FTW/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles

# Deploy the goods!
echo "📦 Deploying configuration files..."
cp -r ~/dotfiles/.config/* ~/.config/

echo "✨ Configuration files deployed! Your desktop is about to get fancy!"
```

### Step 4: Make Fish Your Best Friend 🐠

Time to switch to a shell that actually understands you:

```bash
# Set fish as default shell
chsh -s $(which fish)

# Fish you were here already...
echo "🐠 Welcome to Fish shell! It's better down where it's wetter!"
```

### Step 5: The Moment of Truth 🎭

```bash
echo "🔄 Time to restart! Cross your fingers (and toes)!"
sudo reboot
```

## 🎨 Customization

Now that you've got everything installed, let's make it yours!

### 🖥️ Hyprland Configuration
```bash
# Edit your Hyprland config
nvim ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf
```

Some fun things to try:
```bash
# Make windows do a barrel roll when closing
animations {
    animation=windowsOut,1,7,default,popin 80%
}

# Make your workspace transitions extra fancy
animation=workspaces,1,6,default,slidefade
```

### 🎨 Color Schemes
Want to make your desktop look like:
- 🌈 A unicorn's dream
- 🌙 A cyberpunk nightclub
- 🌺 A peaceful garden
- 👾 A retro arcade

Check out the themes directory: `~/.config/hypr/themes/`

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues (and How to Fix Them Without Crying)

#### 1. Help! My Screen is Black! 😱
```bash
# Check those logs
cat ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.log | grep ERROR

# Or just try this time-honored tradition:
sudo reboot  # The universal "turn it off and on again"
```

#### 2. My Terminal Looks Weird! 🤪
```bash
# Make sure you have your fonts installed
fc-cache -fv
# If that doesn't work, try:
sudo apt install --reinstall fonts-nerd-fonts-complete
# If that still doesn't work:
echo "Time to try a different font! 🎨"
```

#### 3. Nothing is Working! 😭
Don't panic! Here's your emergency checklist:
1. Take a deep breath 🧘‍♂️
2. Make some coffee ☕
3. Check the logs 📝
4. Ask for help in the community 🤝
5. Try turning it off and on again (it works more often than we'd like to admit) 🔄
